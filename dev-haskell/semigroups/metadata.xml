		<flag name="binary">You can disable the use of the `binary` package using `-f-binary`.

Disabling this is an unsupported configuration, but it may be useful for accelerating builds in sandboxes for expert users.</flag>
		<flag name="bytestring">You can disable the use of the `bytestring` package using `-f-bytestring`.

Disabling this is an unsupported configuration, but it may be useful for accelerating builds in sandboxes for expert users.</flag>
		<flag name="bytestring-builder">Decides whether to use an older version of bytestring along with bytestring-builder or just a newer version of bytestring.

This flag normally toggles automatically but you can use `-fbytestring-builder` or `-f-bytestring-builder` to explicitly change it.</flag>
		<flag name="containers">You can disable the use of the `containers` package using `-f-containers`.

Disabling this is an unsupported configuration, but it may be useful for accelerating builds in sandboxes for expert users.</flag>

		<flag name="hashable">You can disable the use of the `hashable` package using `-f-hashable`.

Disabling this is an unsupported configuration, but it may be useful for accelerating builds in sandboxes for expert users.

If disabled we will not supply instances of `Hashable`

Note: `-f-hashable` implies `-f-unordered-containers`, as we are necessarily not able to supply those instances as well.</flag>

Disabling this is an unsupported configuration, but it may be useful for accelerating builds in sandboxes for expert users.</flag>

	<longdescription>
		In mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation. A semigroup generalizes a monoid in that there might not exist an identity element. It also (originally) generalized a group (a monoid with all inverses) to a type where every element did not have to have an inverse, thus the name semigroup.
