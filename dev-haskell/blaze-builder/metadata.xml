		This library provides an implementation of the older
		blaze-builder interface in terms of the new builder that
		shipped with bytestring-0.10.4.0
		
		This implementation is mostly intended as a bridge to the
		new builder,  so that code that uses the old interface
		can interoperate with code that uses the new
		implementation.   Note that no attempt has been made
		to preserve the old internal modules,  so code that
		has these dependencies cannot use this interface.
		
		New code should,  for the most part,  use the new
		interface.   However, this module does implement
		a chunked HTTP encoding,  which is not otherwise
		implemented (yet?) with the new builder.
