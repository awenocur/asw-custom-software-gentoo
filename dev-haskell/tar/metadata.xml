		This library is for working with \&quot;@.tar@\&quot; archive files. It
		can read and write a range of common variations of archive
		format including V7, POSIX USTAR and GNU formats.
		
		It provides support for packing and unpacking portable
		archives. This makes it suitable for distribution but not
		backup because details like file ownership and exact
		permissions are not preserved.
		
		It also provides features for random access to archive
		content using an index.
