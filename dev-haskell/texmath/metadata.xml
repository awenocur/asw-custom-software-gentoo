		The texmath library provides functions to read and
		write TeX math, presentation MathML, and OMML (Office
		Math Markup Language, used in Microsoft Office).
		Support is also included for converting math formats
		to Gnu eqn and to pandoc&#39;s native format (allowing
		conversion, via pandoc, to a variety of different
		markup formats).  The TeX reader supports basic LaTeX
		and AMS extensions, and it can parse and apply LaTeX
		macros.  (See &lt;http://johnmacfarlane.net/texmath here&gt;
		for a live demo of bidirectional conversion between LaTeX
		and MathML.)
		
		The package also includes several utility modules which
		may be useful for anyone looking to manipulate either
		TeX math or MathML.  For example, a copy of the MathML
		operator dictionary is included.
		
		Use the @executable@ flag to install a standalone
		executable, @texmath@, that by default reads a LaTeX
		formula from @stdin@ and writes MathML to @stdout@.
		With flags all the functionality exposed by
		&#39;Text.TeXMath&#39; can be accessed through this executable.
		(Use the @--help@ flag for a description of all
		functionality)
		
		The @texmath@ executable can also be used as a CGI
		script, when renamed as @texmath-cgi@.
		It will expect query parameters for @from@, @to@,
		@input@, and optionally @inline@, and return a JSON
		object with either @error@ and a message or
		@success@ and the converted result.
